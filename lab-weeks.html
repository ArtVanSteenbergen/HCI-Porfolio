				<h1>Lab Weeks</h1>
				<p>As the grand final of the HCI course we moved out of the THUAS building and occupied the 'Maak Haven'. For two weeks we tinkered with electronics and worked on an exposition.</p>

				<h2>Process</h2>
				<p>In this first section I describe the process of making our creation. The Artificial Creature we showed on the expo originated from multiple design iteration and concepts.</p>

				<h3>DAY 1</h3>
				<p>The first day of the lab weeks was exiting, because we’re about to hear in which group, we would be assigned to. After a couple of announcements about being in the “Maak Haven” we could pick up our chairs and look at the group list. This list should me that this portfolio website was on schedule and I was assigned to a group with students whom wanted to do Artificial Creatures as well. I introduced myself to Viktorija Libertyté, Karen Hermandez, Charlotte van Seventer and Stefano Toffoli. After a bit of small talk an getting to know each other we started brainstorming and made a mind map about creatures.</p>

				<p>After we had a clear understanding of what a creature is, we started to list a couple concepts and pick all voted on the ones we liked best. Entertainer and Motivator were both voted four times and we decided to make an Entertaining Motivator/Motivational Entertainer for now.</p>
				<p>We were told to work with a scrum board, so it was clear for the teachers and ourselves what we need to do, what we are doing and to see what we have done. The first post-it we added to this board was jokingly: “make this board”.</p>

				<p>As seen on the board we tried out a Voice Kit from Google. This kit consisted of a Raspberry Pi Zero WH, a Voice Bonnet a speaker, a Micro SD card, a button, a couple if wires and a cardboard frame. After putting this hardware together, we connected to the Raspberry Pi to power and my laptop via Wi-Fi. By following the steps on <a href="https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/">this</a> documentation we had a working Google Assistant in no time. However, when we tried to add text-to-speech we ran into a problem. They have a very serious billing program for using this service. So, we decided to put every component back in the box and return it to the teachers.</p>

				<h3>DAY 2</h3>
				<p>The second day of the lab weeks I brought with me a robot platform. This consisted of four motors, four wheels a frame and a H-bridge. The H-bridge coverts 5v power to a higher voltage so it’s more powerful than just connecting it to an Arduino. To not let it bump into stuff, I attached an Ultrasonic sensor. This sensor sends out and receives ultrasonic signals. The sending is called the trigger and the receiving is called the echo. You can manually code the Arduino to calculate the time it takes sound to travel to an object and back, this way you get a distance value. An easier way to get the distance value is using a library that does this calculation for you. By including the “Ultrasonic” library from <a href="https://github.com/ErickSimoes/Ultrasonic">Erick Simões</a>, you only have to set the echo end trigger pins and you can call the ultrasonic.distanceRead() function to get the distance in centimeters.</p>

				<p>While I was tinkering with the driving platform and optimizing its code, Viktorija and Stefano worked on displaying messages with an LCD unit. They started with this the day before but made major steps today. Karen and Charlotte were busy creating their own capacitive touch sensor using a one megaohm resistor and aluminum foil. At the end of the day they had their breakthrough as well. They could control a LED by touching the piece of aluminum.</p>

				<p>This day we also had the first guest lecture. CEO and Founder of Next Empire, Vincent Lindeboom told us about his work. He showed a lot of interesting AR and VR installations. The one that impressed me the most was ‘Moord In ARtis’ a.k.a. Murder in ARtis. This project featured a story developing based on your location within Artis. The story was only auditive and it would let trough some real-life zoo sounds to be extra immersive. Unfortunately, it’s only online in the winter months so I couldn't go to the zoo to experience it.</p>

				<p>At the start of the day we were told to make our post-it more concrete. We had removed some of our old post-its and tried to make them more descriptive.</p>

				<h3>DAY 3</h3>
				<p>Today we started with a guest lecture from Dr MSc Joost Broekens. He showed us a Tesla Model 3 as part of examples of robots, which made me immediately interested. I’m keeping a close eye on the development of Tesla Motors RoboTaxi’s and the Human Computer Interaction of its to be self-driving cars. He told us on a high level how machine learning and pattern recognition works. I had already seen hundreds of videos about this topic, but his talk was still interesting and he clearly knew where he was talking about.</p>

					<caption>Picture by Charlotte van Seventer; Eye on a LED MATRIX</caption>
				</figure>
				<p>We borrowed a LED Matrix and started to tinker with it. After reading some documentation online I pretty much understood how to program it. When the matrix was connected to my Arduino, I uploaded the code and noticed the LED Matrix staring at me with an eye. When I had put a lot of byte data in the code to make it blink the code became pretty much unreadable and almost impossible to code. Therefore, I opened my browser and Googled “LED Matrix Generator”. One of the first links gave brought me to a <a href="https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor/">GitHub project</a> with the exact thing I was looking for. With this tool it was very easy to program different eyes and transitioning frames. It even gave the option to use 64-bit long integers instead of byte arrays. So, the code could be a lot shorter. I quickly made a stare, look around and blink function that made the eye really come to live.</p>
				<p>Near the end of the day we received a MP3 Shield I ordered, but there was no time to test it. A micro SD card was also needed to make it work, therefor I decided to test it the next day.</p>

				<p>By looking at our scrum board after the third day you can see that we made a lot of progress.</p>

				<h3>DAY 4</h3>
				<p>The fourth day started with a lecture again. This time it was Teun Verkerk whom held the quest lecture. He talked in great detail about his project BUQS which in essence where small artificial creatures that were making little noises. He emphasized how simple sounds can add a lot of life and character to an artificial creature. Another big take away was that we should avoid taking our creatures to for so their expressions would be in the uncanny valley. That basically means when that when your very close to perfectly mimicking a face, it would result in people seeing the face but know that something isn’t right. We learned to keep it simple and to not get lost in the details.</p>
				<figure>

				<p>After the lecture I started installing the MP3 shield on my Arduino and searched for the right libraries. This took longer than expected and I tried many different thinks. Then I noticed that the shield wasn’t fully connected to the Arduino. After fully installing, it worked like a charm. It played MP3 tracks that I installed on the Micro SD Card. The big downside of the MP3 shield was that it almost used every pin of the Arduino. So we couldn’t use it with the other plans. We discussed this in the group and Victorija pointed out that we shouldn’t make the creature to complex. We could accomplish a lot with just the Piezo speaker. So, we decided to ditch the MP3 shield and started working on the eyes and eyebrows in combination with the speaker. I was appointed to make the sounds of the creature for every emotional state it would get. After riding some loops with the tone function I was already satisfied by the result. When we combined the eyes from Charlotte and Karen with the short beeps and boops I created, the creature got a lot of character.</p>

				<p>The teachers made us come up with a promise we would make to the visitors of the expo the next week. As an example one of the teachers Chris made the promise to us that we would talk like Penguins. The example was a bit vague but I guess that was the point. After a little brainstorm session we concluded that we would promise our guests to let them stroke the beard. Which we thought of as very engaging. Victorija started to make a flow chart so we would know what we would need for our creature to work as intendend and she made blueprints of the design.</p>
